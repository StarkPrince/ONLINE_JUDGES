Euler totient is the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.

Observations 1:
the totient of a totient of a number is less than the number//2

//case1 : n = 1
there is exactly one prime number, so the totient function is 1.

//case2 : n is a prime number
the totient function is n-1, since n is a prime number, so all numbers less than n are relatively prime to n.

//case3 : n is a composite number
the totient function is the product of all the prime factors of n, so the totient function is the product of all the prime factors of n.

//case4 : n is a exponent of a prime number
the totient function is the p**k - p**(k-1) where n = p**k
