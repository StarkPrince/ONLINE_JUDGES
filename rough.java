// describe each line of code
// describe the codes aim
// the aim of the code is to print the string MIS103***103 and the value of price with 4 decimal places


Steps involved to solve the question
1. create a class called HelloWorld
2. create a method called main that takes no arguments
3. create a string variable called name and assign it the value MIS103
4. print the first 3 characters of the string name
5. print the string name2
6. print the last 3 characters of the string name
7. create a double variable called price and assign it the value of 100/3
8. print the value of price with 4 decimal places
9. create an integer variable called i and assign it the value 0
10. while the value of sum is less than 180 do the following
11. increment the value of i by 1
12. subtract the value of i from the value of sum
13. print the value of i
14. create an integer variable called n and assign it the value 8
15. while the value of n is greater than 0 do the following
16. decrement the value of n by 1
17. print the value of n
