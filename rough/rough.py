# A ski lift has a one-way length of 1 km and a vertical rise of 200 m. The chairs are spaced 20 m apart, and each chair can seat three people. The lift is operating at a steady speed of 10 km/h. Neglecting friction and air drag, and assuming that the average mass of each loaded chair is 250 kg, determine the power required to operate this ski lift. Also, estimate the power required to accelerate this ski lift in 6 s to its operating speed when it is first turned on.

# The power required to operate the ski lift is  kW.

# The power required to accelerate this ski life in 6 s to its operating speed is  kW.

# Distance (d) = 1km = 1000m

# Average speed (v)=10km/h

# the average mass of each chair =m=250kg

# Vertical height (h) = 200m

# given variables and their values
# Step 2 of 4
# Total mass (M) = m√ón

# where, n is number of chairs placed in 1000m

# calculate n,M, and W using the given values
